# Portfolio
## About me
My name is Marina Bershova. I want to study a new specialty in the field of IT, I want to become a Software tester. The IT interested me for a long time, so for the last six months I have been trying to understand and acquire the specifics of IT professions. I have already tried myself in front-end development and it was very interesting and exciting. But, in my opinion, Software testing is one of the main and necessary processes that make it possible to obtain a quality product and service. In this portfolio I want to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the front end development and testing course I have completed and through self-learning.
